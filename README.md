## Overview
### Description
Application to track a user's run and collects information like the run distance, time elapsed, average speed. The user will create an account and has options like staying logged in and registering with an email. There will also be a way to show the user's run on a map. The application will have a home page with various tabs to let the user select what they want to do next.

### App Evaluation
- **Category: Health and Fitness**
- **Mobile: iPhone 12**
- **Story: We decided to make this application to allow users to track their runs. As a runner, I wanted an alternative to Strava and to experiment with iOS development**
- **Market: People of all ages and levels that enjoy running.**
- **Habit: Used on an ad hoc basis. Depends on when the user goes for a run**
- **Scope: Pertains to individual users as opposed to businesses.**

## Schema
### Models
| Property      | Type     | Description |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| userId        | String   | unique id for the user (primary key) |
| username      | String   | username |
| password      | String   | hash of the user's password |
| email         | String   | user's email address |

### Networking
- Sign Up Screen
   - (Create/POST) Create user with Email, Username, and Hash of Password
- Login Screen
   - (Read/GET) Query all user’s usernames to see if username exists. Then, query username’s password hash to see if the entered password’s hash matches up. If the hash matches, we can log the user in using the supplied input.
- Feed Screen
   - No network request made here. Displays user’s last run data, which is stored on the device. Since we are only storing the last run’s data, we simply overwrite the last run’s data values every time a new run is completed, and use the new run’s values for display.
- Active Run Screen
   - No parse requests made from this screen. This screen will need to contact the maps API, however, to display the active location of the runner. Somehow the time elapsed, distance, average pace, and JSONified map data will need to be stored to the device.
- Settings Screen
   - (Update/PUT) Update Email, Username, Password for logged in user

- [Create basic snippets for each Parse network request]
- No APIs are used - only Apple MapKit is used.
